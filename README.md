# Pneumonia Detection Using Feature-Level Ensemble of CNNs
This project uses a feature-level ensemble method by combining features from multiple pre-trained CNN models (VGG19, EfficientNetB0, and others) to enhance pneumonia detection accuracy from chest X-rays. Grad-CAM is used to generate visual heatmaps for better interpretability.
